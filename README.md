Tic Tac Toe Game

Summary and Description:-

This project is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design and an intuitive user interface, allowing two players to compete by taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game includes win detection logic to announce the winner or declare a draw, and provides options to reset the game or start a new one. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of basic web development skills and game logic implementation.

Steps:-
HTML Structure: Set up the basic structure of the web page with a main container for the Tic Tac Toe grid, message container, and buttons for resetting or starting a new game.
CSS Styling: Designed the layout, colors, and appearance of the game board and buttons to ensure a responsive and visually appealing interface.
Game Initialization: Selected all grid boxes, buttons, and message container elements using JavaScript for interaction.
Player Turn Handling: Implemented event listeners on each grid box to handle player turns, marking boxes with "X" or "O" alternately.
Move Tracking: Kept track of the number of moves to determine if the game ends in a draw.
Win Detection: Defined win patterns and implemented logic to check if any player has won after each move.
Display Winner or Draw: Showed appropriate messages when a player wins or the game ends in a draw, and disabled further moves.
Reset and New Game: Provided functionality to reset the game board and start a new game, re-enabling the boxes and clearing the marks.
Responsive Design: Ensured the game works well on different screen sizes by using flexible units in CSS.
User Interaction: Enhanced user experience with intuitive game controls and visual feedback on game state changes.
